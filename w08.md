# Top 10 List of Week 

1. [CPU Scheduling](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/cpu-scheduling)<br>
    CPU scheduling is a process that allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold(in waiting state) due to unavailability of any resource like I/O etc, thereby making full use of CPU. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast, and fair.This article explains about CPU scheduling in a clear manner. They included some graphs and tables to further explain the concept. 

2. [Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling/)<br>
    Preemptive scheduling is used when a process switches from running state to ready state or from waiting state to ready state. Non-preemptive Scheduling is used when a process terminates, or a process switches from running to waiting state. The article also lists the key difference between the two. This topic is actually mentioned in the last article, but it is further explained here. 

3. [Arrival Time vs Burst Time](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-arrival-time-and-burst-time-in-cpu-scheduling/)<br>
    Arrival time is the point of time in milli seconds at which a process arrives at the ready queue to begin the execution. Burst Time refers to the time required in milli seconds by a process for its execution. The Burst Time takes into consideration the CPU time of a process. This article explains the concept very well. It even includes a concise table of differences between the two. 

4. [Mix Burst Time (CPU & IO Both)](https://dev.to/rahulmishra05/mix-burst-time-cpu-i-o-both-operating-system-m02-p09-2e5o)<br>
    The article explains about mixed burst time quite clearly. It includes tables and step by step tutorials to understand the concept. It's actually part of a series, the entire series talks about scheduling. I could use all my slots on top10 links on each part of the series, but I decided not to :D Anyway, the writer delivered it in nicely sized chunks of material so it's easier to understand. 

5. [Shortest Job First Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.guru99.com/shortest-job-first-sjf-scheduling.html)<br>
    Shortest Job First (SJF) is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution. This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive. It significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes awaiting execution. The article describes step by step how this algorithm works and includes a lot of figures to further convey the topic clearly. 
    
6. [Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.guru99.com/round-robin-scheduling-example.html)<br>
    The name of this algorithm comes from the round-robin principle, where each person gets an equal share of something in turns. It is the oldest, simplest scheduling algorithm, which is mostly used for multitasking. In Round-robin scheduling, each ready task runs turn by turn only in a cyclic queue for a limited time slice. This algorithm also offers starvation free execution of processes. The article is very thorough as it contains materials about what round-robin scheduling is, its characteristics, examples, advantages and disadvantages, and the worst case latency. 

7. [First Come First Serve Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.guru99.com/fcfs-scheduling.html)<br>
    First Come First Serve (FCFS) is an operating system scheduling algorithm that automatically executes queued requests and processes in order of their arrival. It is the easiest and simplest CPU scheduling algorithm. In this type of algorithm, processes which requests the CPU first get the CPU allocation first. The article includes examples cases and explains how it works accompanied with a lot of tables. 

8. [Priority Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.guru99.com/priority-scheduling-program.html)<br>
    Priority Scheduling is a method of scheduling processes that is based on priority. In this algorithm, the scheduler selects the tasks to work as per the priority. The processes with higher priority should be carried out first, whereas jobs with equal priorities are carried out on a round-robin or FCFS basis. Priority depends upon memory requirements, time requirements, etc. The article describes step by step how this algorithm works and includes a lot of figures to further convey the topic clearly.

9. [Multilevel Queues Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multilevel-queue-mlq-cpu-scheduling/)<br>
    The article explains about multilevel queues scheduling in short paragraphs that's easy to read. It includes advantages and disadvantages of using this algorithm as well. 
    
10. [Comparison of Scheduling Algorithms](https://unacademy.com/lesson/comparison-of-scheduling-algorithms/BYKW5NJZ)<br>
    To sum up the previous links, this video compares all the scheduling algorithms and offers figures, examples, and a clear explanation about each one. It also presents the advantages and disadvantages of each scheduling algorithm. It's a great way to end this week's GSGS journey.
