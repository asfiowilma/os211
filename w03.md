# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [Crash Course on Files & File Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN8YgJnShPM)<br/> 
    This video provides an overview about the key principles of file systems. As I learn from this video, the file system is the part of operating system that manages and keeps track of files. The video itself is very compact and great as both overview AND review material. 

2. [Inside the Mac Filesystem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRtx2X-T3gk)<br/>
    Continuing on my file system journey, this is a video on Mac's file system. It turns out to be quite different than the ones Microsoft's Windows used. Apple hides a lot of files from the eyes, but almost every file behind an application is accessible and can be browsed by the file explorer. I find this interesting, as I never used MacOS myself.

3. [Different Kinds of File Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRtx2X-T3gk)<br/>
    I never knew there was more than one kind of file system. This video mentioned a lot of file system names that I've never heard before. According to the presenter, it turns out that the file system that Microsoft uses are not the best. Right now, I can't really tell the difference because I never looked it up, but having learned that there's a lot more to learn out there makes me a little curious.

4. [Windows File Systems as Fast as Possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV0-EPUYuQc)<br/>
    This time, it's all about Windows' file systems. Most of them has FAT in their names, which I find a bit quirky. The video provides some sort of timeline/history about almost every file system that Windows' used. It's a quick watch, and I watched it in 2x speed so it's even faster. :D

5. [About Linux Tarballs, Archive, and Compress Folders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0yqs8t6ywo)<br/>
    I got curious when W03's assignment had us download some kind of .tar file and decrypt it locally. I learned that tarball is some kind of file compression method. When we want to transport a folder consisting of several files, we can generate a tarball, which is one solid file containing all the data from the folder aforementioned, and this is the file that we can send. As the tar file gets decrypted, we can get the initial folder and have everything in there. Like magic!
